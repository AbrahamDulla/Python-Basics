# In Python, there are several built-in data types:

# 1 Numeric data types:
# int (integers)
age = 26
# float (floating-point numbers)
height = 1.68
# complex (complex numbers)


# 2 Sequential data types:
# str (string)
name = "Abraham"
# list (ordered collection of items)
# tuple (immutable ordered collection of items)

# 3 Mapping data type:
# dict (unordered collection of key-value pairs)

# 4 Set data types:
# set (unordered collection of unique items)
# frozenset (immutable unordered collection of unique items)

# 5 Boolean data type:
# bool (True or False)

# 6 Binary data types:
# bytes (immutable sequence of bytes)
# bytearray (mutable sequence of bytes)

# Others:
# None (special constant used to denote the absence of a value)
# Ellipsis (special constant used in slicing operations)
